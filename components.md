Components

## Components in sunriseJS
Every component is like an addon for the entity which owns the component.
Asume we have a ```Bot``` entity and we want at some point to be very a very hard enemy and at some other point the bot shoult be very easy.
Now we can simply write two components which control the behavior of the bot. If we now add a bot to the level we can choose which strength the bot should have by adding one of the components.

Note: You can add as much components to an entity as you want.
